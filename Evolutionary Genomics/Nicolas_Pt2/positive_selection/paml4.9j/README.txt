README.txt for PAML

PAML (for Phylogentic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) contains a few
programs for model fitting and phylogenetic tree reconstruction using
nucleotide or amino-acid sequence data.  ANSI C source codes as well
as Win32 and MC OSX excutables are distributed.  Win32 executables are 
in the folder bin.  Type, say, 
	bin\codeml
to run the codeml program.  For UNIX and OS-X systems, go to the src/ 
folder to compile the programs: "cd src" and then "make".

The documentation is in doc/pamlDOC.pdf.  The program web page is the 
following, where the archive can be downloaded:
