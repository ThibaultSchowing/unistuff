# Introduction to Signal and Image Processing
## Sample homework hand-in
We provide here an example homework hand-in. Note that we do not impose the use of latex to type the report: Microsoft Word, Libreoffice will work just as fine.

## Content
- The `src` directory will contain your source code, and if necessary the data necessary to compute your results (images, ...). If the data is too large in size, you can leave it out.
- The `pics` directory will contain the images and figures that you show in the report.
- `report.tex` is the example latex file that you may adapt. We recommend that you install the [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution and compile your document with `pdflatex`.
