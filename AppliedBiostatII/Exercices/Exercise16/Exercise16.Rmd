## Exercise 16

The data set video.csv (available on ILIAS) contains measurements of a study in which
psychologists measured the ability of probands of different age groups in learning to play a video
game. The data set has the following variables:

* id initials of the subjects
* age age of the probands
* trial 1: first trial, 2: second trial, . . . , 5: fifth trial
* score score in the video game (response variable)

You can treat trial as a numerical variable.

```{r}
data = read.table("video.csv", header = T, sep = ';')
summary(data)
plot(data)
```

```{r}
data.fit <- lm(score ~trial, data = data)
plot(data$trial, data$score)
abline(data.fit)
```
