# Series 1: Malthus and Verhulst model

## Malthus model

Use the function “ode” to solve numerically Malthus’ model. Show the trajectory for the two following set of parameters and initial conditions.





```{r}
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)
#?ode
```


a) $$r = 0.2$$, and $$N_0 = 5$$

```{r}

# Parameters passed to func
p <- list(r = 0.2)

# Integrator
m <- c("ode45")

# Differential equation
#
# Params: 
#        - t: never used here but must remains. Offers the possibility to have time dependant differential equations.
#        - N: population size at which the time derivative will be evaluated. A list with one element per dimention. For Malthus it is simply a list of 1 element.
#        - p: parameters list 
func <- function(t,N,p){
  dN <- p$r * N
  return(list(c(dN)))
}

# Time stemps for the numerical solution
time_steps <- seq(0,10,0.01)

# Initial state values for the ODE system
N0 <- 5

# Run the "ode" function
out <- ode(y = N0, times = time_steps, func = f, parms = p, method = m)

```





b) $$r = -2$$, and $$N_0 = 5$$
