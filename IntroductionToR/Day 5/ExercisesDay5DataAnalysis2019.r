# Exercise 5.3. ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here we want to check that the CI contains the true parameter value in 95% of times, 
# if we repeated the sampling procedure 100 times
# Imagine that the height of students follow a Normal distribution with mean 170 and standard deviation 10 (cm)
# 5.3.1. Simulate a random sample of 20 students using function rnorm() and save it into a variable

# 5.3.2. Compute the 95% CI of the simulated sample using the t.test() function and save it into a variable.

# the output of t.test() function is a list.
# use str() function to check the structure of the variable where you saved the output of t.test().

# that outputs the 95% CI

# also it generates a normal distribution

# Exercize 5.5 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Create a contingency table showing the frequency distiribution of the variables 
# "Sex" and "Smoking". Use the chi square test to test if the two variables are independent.
# Hint 1: If you pass a contingency table to the function "chisq.test, Pearson's chi-squared test is 
# performed with the null hypothesis that the joint distribution of the cell counts in a 2-dimensional 
my.table <- table(df2$Sex, df2$Smoking);my.table

chisq.test(my.table)

# contingency table is the product of the row and column marginals.
# Hint 2: Two random variables X and Y are independent if P (X = x and Y = y) = P(X = x) P(Y = y).

#p-value is < 0.05 -> smaller than 0.05 -> smoking habits are different.
# Warnings: some of the expected entries are smaller than 5 -> small sample

# Exercize 5.6 --------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5.6.2 Now plot the line that goes through the qqplot points. What does it tell you? 
#       Note: This cannot be done using qqline, which only applies to qqnorm.
# 5.6.3 Further check the relationship between the two vaiables by plotting 
# the data against each other and overlay a regression line obtained using the lm function
